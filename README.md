# p-transport-api



#  Description
This project serves as a middle process in the API-led connectivity architecture, specifically focusing on the process API. It involves the setup of JMS Queues (ActiveMQ) as the initial step, as it allows fetching records based on new messages received from the Queue. The project handles four different types of records for four interfaces: AS, Salesforce, SAP, and QMS.

Within the project, the Scatter-Gather pattern is utilized to execute multiple interfaces in parallel. This enables simultaneous processing of different interfaces. The Scatter-Gather component includes four choices, each directing the correct response data to the respective interface.

Error handling is a critical aspect of the project. It incorporates the "On Error" mechanism to handle various errors, such as JMS publishing errors (JMS:PUBLISHING) and destination not found errors (JMS:DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND). Proper error handling ensures smooth execution and enhances the reliability of the system.

Additionally, the project includes MUnit test cases, achieving a code coverage of 70%. The test cases validate the functionality of the code and ensure expected results are achieved. To facilitate testing and minimize dependencies, third-party APIs are effectively mocked.

#  Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

Set up the JMS Queues (ActiveMQ) to establish the necessary queues for the project. Configure the connection details, including the broker URL, username, and password.
Ensure the integration with the respective interfaces (AS, Salesforce, SAP, QMS) is correctly established. Set up the required connectivity components, such as API connectors, credentials, and endpoint configurations.
Implement the process API logic to fetch records from the JMS Queue upon receiving new messages.
Define the handling logic for the four different types of records, segregating them based on their interface (AS, Salesforce, SAP, QMS).
Utilize the Scatter-Gather pattern to execute the different interfaces in parallel, allowing for efficient and simultaneous processing.
Configure the choices within the Scatter-Gather component to direct the correct response data to the respective interface.
Implement the insertion logic to add the processed data into the corresponding JMS Queues for each interface.
Incorporate the "On Error" mechanism to handle JMS publishing errors (JMS:PUBLISHING) and destination not found errors (JMS:DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND).
Develop MUnit test cases to validate the functionality of the code. Aim for a code coverage of 70% to ensure comprehensive testing.
Utilize effective mocking techniques to simulate the behavior of third-party APIs during testing, minimizing dependencies.
